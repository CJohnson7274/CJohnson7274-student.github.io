Hobby: I love playing Hockey and my fraternity and being with friends, I had started playing hockey when I was 12 and I have continued to do so as a 21 year old. My fraternity is Phi Delta Theta and they have quickly gone from brothers to best friends I wouldnt change my decision for the world, we beleive in builfing strong men with even stronger foundations of kindness and trust and truth for its own sake.
